# JHPortfolio
Have a gaze at: https://joseph-hu-portfolio.netlify.app/#home

Technologies Used:

React, Sanity, Framer Motion


Approach Taken

I can't take full credit for this portfolio, i did take inspiration from ADRIANHAJDIN's youtube tutorial on responsive react websites. I did however build it from scratch and the process still took me a whole week. This was mainly because i just really wanted to get good at react and learn about features in react such as higher order functions and i wanted to get some practice using framer motion. I also wanted more practice using a backend and i was really curious to learn sanity.

During the project

I didn't necessarily like all aspects of the tutorial so i did tweak it quite a bit to style it into my own personal brand. Mainly i just wanted to make sure i was understanding what was going on. Hence the insane amount of comments i have throughout my code (i probably wrote more lines of comments than actual code).

Making the best out of it

Overall i thought it was quite a good project and i had a lot of fun with it. Framer motion is super interesting and i'll definitely use it more in the future. Sanity was suprisingly easy to set up and this was also my first exposure to higher order components. I didn't even know they were a thing, i hope to use them a lot more in the future.

Unsolved Problems

Definitely need to update the content on the site in the future. I'm not the best at writing about myself. I also just...don't have that much experience to put on my portfolio as i'm just starting out but hopefully i'll have a fuller portfolio in the future.
